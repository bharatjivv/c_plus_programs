Create 2 classes:
    1. Simplecalcuator - Takes input of two numbers using a utility
        functions and performs +, -, *, / and displays the result using 
        another function.

    2. ScientificCalculator - Takes input of 2 numbers using a utility 
        function and performs any four scientific operation of your choice. 

    Create another class HybridCalculator and inherit it using these 2 classes.

    Q.1 What type of inheritence are you using ?
    Q.2 Which mode of inheritence are you using ?
    Q.3 Create an object of HybridCalculator and display result 
        of simple and scientific calculator.
    Q.4 How is code-reusability implemented ?
